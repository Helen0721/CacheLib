FreeMem: 

The FreeMem strategy is never actually getting triggered, even when we vary the reb parameters.
The main source of failure comes from the total free memory of the class is smaller than pre-defined threshold. 
-> The pre-defined threshold is the minimum number of slabs existed. 
-> The total free memory of a class is usually 0.
The rebalancing strategies are triggered sometimes when there is a alloc failure.

Therefore the stats don't vary as much.


HitsPerSlab:

I varied the minDiff, diffRatio, minSlabs, and numSlabsFreeMem.

The impact factor is cache size > eviction algorithm > HitsPerSlab parameters. 
We actually don't want the HitsPerSlab strategy to be triggered too often. 

256MB: Varying the rebalance parameters usually cause the final miss ratio to vary for 0.04% - 0.07%. 
512MB: 0.02% - 0.03%
1GB: 0...

The larger the cache size, the smaller the difference. Once we hit 32GB, no difference observed. 


LruTailAge:
Triggering LruTailAge is better than not triggering for cache size from 2GB to 16GB, inclusive
Lru2Q for some reasons never triggered LruTailAge. The difference between vPTA and rTA is too small. 

256MB:
Not triggerd. The main reason for not getting triggered is (vPTA - rTA) improv. < minTailAgeDifference.
Their difference is usually like less than 5.
Not really sure where the difference is coming from tho. 
But we observe the for TinyLFU, the rebalance parameters seem to affect the number of attempts made. 
512MB:
Triggered for TinyLFU (like 1/83 and 4/92)
minTailAgeDifference,numSlabsFreeMem makes the difference.
1GB:
Triggered for TinyLFU (like 5/81 and 6/87)
minTailAgeDifference,numSlabsFreeMem makes the difference.

2GB:
Sometimes Triggered for Lru. 
This one showed that rebalancing can be helpful.

MarginalHits:
I mainly varied the movingAverageParam [0.2,0.3,0.4]
the difference for varying the parameters are usualy less than 0.1%. 
For cache size from 1GB to 16GB inclusive, MarginalHits is triggered more than 80% of the time.
