FreeMem: 

The FreeMem strategy is not getting triggered, even when we vary the reb parameters.
The main source of failure comes from the total free memory of the class is smaller than pre-defined threshold. 
-> The pre-defined threshold is the minimum number of slabs existed. 
-> The total free memory of a class is usually 0.
The rebalancing strategies are triggered sometimes when there is a alloc failure.

Therefore the stats don't vary as much.


HitsPerSlab:

I varied the minDiff, diffRatio, minSlabs, and numSlabsFreeMem.

At 256MB: 
The best configuration is minDiff:100,diffRatio:0.200000,minSlabs:2,numSlabsFreeMem:0,minLruTailAge:0,maxLruTailAge:0
where the miss ratio becomes 0.196.
The worst configuration is minDiff:20,diffRatio:0.200000,minSlabs:3,numSlabsFreeMem:0,minLruTailAge:0,maxLruTailAge:0, with miss ratio 0.201571. 
The strategy is triggered around half of the time. 1/5 a slab is released according to alloc failure.

The main source of failure comes from:
1. the Receiver class's projected delta hits per slab (rDHpS) is less than the victim's projected delta hits per slab (vPDHpS) 
2. the difference between (vPDHpS - rDHpS)  is not greater than diff ratio * victim's projected delta hits per slab.


At 512MB:
The best configuration is Lru with 100,1,0.2,2,0,0 (minDiff,minSlabs,diffRatio,numSlabsFreeMem,minLruTailAge,maxLruTailAge). The miss ratio is 0.11747
The worst configuration is Lru2Q with 100,1,0.05,3,0,0 (minDiff,minSlabs,diffRatio,numSlabsFreeMem,minLruTailAge,maxLruTailAge). The miss ratio is 0.1207. 

The strategy is triggered over 95% of the time. 
We see a little bit of the difference between (vPDHpS - rDHpS) not greater than the diff ratio. 


At 1GB:
The best miss ratio is 0.074114. Configuration is 20,1,0.1,2,0,0 (minDiff,minSlabs,diffRatio,numSlabsFreeMem,minLruTailAge,maxLruTailAge)
The worst miss ratio is 0.075513. Configuration is 100,1,0.1,1,0,0 (minDiff,minSlabs,diffRatio,numSlabsFreeMem,minLruTailAge,maxLruTailAge)
